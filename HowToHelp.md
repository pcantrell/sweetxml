Want to help out? There are several tasks with which you can lend a hand:

  * Port the converters to your favorite language. Especially interested in: Ruby, Python, Javascript, C# (should be an easy port from Java!), and Haskell (for the geek cachet, of course).
  * Add syntax highlighting and other editing support to your favorite IDE or text editor. Especially interested in: TextMate, Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans.
  * Write a processing plug-in for your favorite build tool.
  * Write a .bat file to provide the command-line interface to those unfortunate souls who don't have a proper shell at their disposal.

If you can help with one of these tasks, post a message on [the discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/sweetxml) and we'll talk!
