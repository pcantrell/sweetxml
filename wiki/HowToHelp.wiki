#summary Ways to help the SweetXML project.

Want to help out? There are several tasks with which you can lend a hand:
  * Port the converters to Ruby, Python, or your favorite language.
  * Write a plug-in for your favorite IDE / build tool.
  * Build a regression testing framework which will work off of test files that all the different languages can share.
