#summary Ways to help the SweetXML project.

Want to help out? There are several tasks with which you can lend a hand:

  * Port the converters to your favorite language. Especially interested in: Ruby, Python, Javascript, C# (should be an easy port from Java!), and Haskell (for the geek cachet, of course).
  * Add syntax highlighting and other editing support to your favorite IDE or text editor. Especially interested in: Text**Mate, Eclipse, IntelliJ, Net**Beans.
  * Write a processing plug-in for your favorite build tool.
  * Write a .bat file to provide the command-line interface to those unfortunate souls who don't have a proper shell at their disposal.
  * Help build a regression testing framework which will work off of test files that all the different languages can share.

If you can help with one of these tasks, post a message on [http://groups.google.com/group/sweetxml the discussion group] and we'll talk!
